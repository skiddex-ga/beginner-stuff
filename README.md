my git.hub learning files
I am learning Node-Red.
It is currently deployed on both Windows 8.1 and Raspberry Pi Stretch.
My learning experience will be documented here.
The first difficulty I met was editing settings.js on the RP to include projects.
I found that the file had to be edited by adding a comma after the next to the last curly brace, then adding the projects code.
